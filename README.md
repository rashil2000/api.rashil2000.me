# Personal Website Backend

> [!NOTE]
> This application is no longer in use. All of the functionality of this backend has been moved to server components in the [Next.js frontend](https://github.com/rashil2000/rashil2000.me/). 

### A complete content management backend for personal blogs and projects

### Key features:

- Implemented using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework.
- Uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL database for modern applications, along with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for object data modeling.
- Implements local authentication using [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/).
- Handles static file uploads using the [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) middleware.
- Generates [directory-tree](https://github.com/mihneadb/node-directory-tree) for static assets.

Documentation has been generated through [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), which can be viewed upon visiting the link above. The different API routes can be seen there.

The API endpoints and database are utilized on [rashil2000.me](https://rashil2000.me/) - my personal website written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using React - whose source code can be found [here](https://github.com/rashil2000/rashil2000.me/).
